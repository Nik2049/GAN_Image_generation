This is a fastai notebook that has been edited to create a new image.
I have played around with different learning rates, 2e-5, 1e-4 and some more and ran this to about 2000 epochs.
I could only get 2000 images after scraping google, wikipedia and Flickr, due to the dearth of data especially for a GAN the images that were created were not very clear. 
Anybody who is interested to take this further to create a clearer image, please feel free to email me on nikhil.chandna49@gmail.com to ask for the data.
